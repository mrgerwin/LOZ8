Extensions -  
1. Add a start screen.  You can find the title screen image here: 
2. Add music to the start screen.  Your choice of music here.  But here is where I have gotten sounds: 
3. Use the waitPress function.  Once the user presses a key:  
  -the start screen should disappear and the sprites should be shown.  
  -a sound effect should play  
  -the music should stop  
  -the legend of zelda theme music should start and you should be able to play the game normally  
  
Challenge -
1. In the original game, the waterfall was animated by using three different colors for the water.  Program this or animate something else if your start screen is different.
2. Use GIMP to change the colors of the letters so that you have different colors.  Save as different image files.  Change the background image through these image files to create the illusion that the letters are animated.  Again see original Legend of Zelda game on youTube to see what I mean.
